## [Unreleased]

### Changed

  * Several updates throughout to bring this repository more in line with the project template I normally use.
    * Updated:
      * CONTRIBUTING.md — updated to use my most current project template contributing information.
      * README.md — updated to more closely follow my preferred layout for README files.
      * composer.json — updated dependencies and modified the `scripts` to more closely match my project template.
  * Merged the `main`, `psalm`, and `tests` workflows in `.github/workflows` into one workflow file `continuous-integration.yml`.
  * Various updates to PHPDocs and code, throughout the entire library, to improve type safety and coverage as much as possible.
    *  This includes updating PHPDoc blocks in the PaginatorInterface to provide clarification on the expected `Closure` signatures 
       for the `itemTotalCallback` and `sliceCallback` callbacks. Further documentation for this is on the TODO list.

### Added

  * Added `rector` as a dev-dependency.
    * Adds `rector.php` in the main repo for Rector configuration.
  * Added a new `release` workflow to `.github/workflows` to allow automatic creation of a release when a tag is pushed.
